# Compiler From C-Subset to RISC-V

This project implements a C-subset compiler developed as part of our Compiler Design Lab course.

Our project is to develop a compiler that translates programs written in a custom language (whose allowed instructions are a subset of the C programming language) into executable RISC-V assembly code. We will also apply selected optimizations to improve the efficiency of the generated code.

The implementation follows the classical compiler pipeline:

- Lexical Analysis

- Syntax Analysis (Parsing)

- Semantic Analysis

- Intermediate Processing

- Code Generation (RISC-V)

- Basic Optimizations
